      <description>The mug
Was fug,
The pug
Was smug
And the jug
Was fug.
The pug said &amp;#34;I am smug&amp;#34;,
The mug said &amp;#34;I am fug&amp;#34;
And the jug said &amp;#34;I am also fug&amp;#34;.
When the pug got transferred from the mug
To the jug
The pug
became fug,
The jug became smug,
And the mug became smug.
The pug said &amp;#34;I am fug&amp;#34;,
The mug said &amp;#34;I am smug&amp;#34;</description>

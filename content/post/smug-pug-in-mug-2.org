The smug pug\\
Who was in the mug\\
Said "I am smug"\\
Then the pug said "I am in the mug"\\
The pug was transferred from the Mug\\
to the jug\\
And the pug\\
Was fug\\
And in a jug\\
The pug said "I am fug"\\
And then said "I am in a jug".\\
The bug\\
In the rug\\
Said "I am a bug"\\
Then also said "I am in a rug"\\
And "A tug boat is brilliant"
